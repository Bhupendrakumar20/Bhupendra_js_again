<!-- async intro-->

//JS is synchornous and single-threaded
//JavaScript is synchronous, meaning it executes code line by line, in the order it appears. This can lead to blocking behavior,
//JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one piece of code at a time. 

//Asynchronous operations are typically handled using callbacks, promises, or async/await syntax.



//block code and non -blocking code
//Blocking code is code that stops the execution of subsequent code until it completes. 
//Non-blocking code allows the program to continue executing while waiting for an operation to complete.
//For example, a blocking operation might be a long-running loop or a synchronous HTTP request that waits for a response before continuing.

//real world example of blocking and non-blocking code

//Blocking code example:
//like a authantication process that requires user input before proceeding.
function blockingOperation() {
    console.log("Starting blocking operation...");
    // Simulate a blocking operation (e.g., user input)
    const userInput = prompt("Please enter your name:");
    console.log(`Blocking operation completed with input: ${userInput}`);
}

//Non-blocking code example:
//when their is non depended task comes
